# Google Form Integration for Academic Excellence

## 🎯 Overview

I've created a comprehensive Academic Project Request system that integrates with your website and sends detailed form submissions directly to your Gmail at `singhal3.sachin7@gmail.com`.

## ✅ What's Been Implemented

### 1. **Advanced Form Modal**
- **Location**: `client/src/components/academic-form-modal.tsx`
- **Features**:
  - Student information capture (name, email, phone, institution, course, semester)
  - Project details (type, domain, title, description, requirements)
  - Timeline and budget selection
  - PowerPoint presentation option
  - Additional notes section
  - Professional validation and error handling

### 2. **API Endpoint**
- **Location**: `api/academic-form.ts`
- **Purpose**: Processes form submissions and formats email notifications
- **Email Format**: Professional Gmail-ready format with emojis and clear sections

### 3. **Enhanced UI Integration**
- **Updated Button**: "Fill Project Form" instead of "Order Project Now"
- **Modal Trigger**: Clicking the main button opens the detailed form
- **Toast Notifications**: User feedback for form actions
