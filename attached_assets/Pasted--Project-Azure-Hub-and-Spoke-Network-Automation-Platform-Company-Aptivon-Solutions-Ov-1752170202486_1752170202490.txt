**Project: Azure Hub‑and‑Spoke Network Automation Platform**
**Company:** Aptivon Solutions

**Overview:**
Developed a turnkey, web‑based network‑management platform that automates the design, deployment, security enforcement, and ongoing monitoring of Azure hub‑and‑spoke architectures. This solution replaced manual ARM/CLI workflows with a self‑service portal, enabling rapid, policy‑driven provisioning of virtual networks and related services—while maintaining strict compliance and cost controls.

**Key Features:**

* **Infrastructure as Code**

  * One‑click generation of ARM templates or Terraform plans for hub and spoke VNets
  * Automated configuration of VPN/ExpressRoute gateways, VNet peering, and user‑defined routes
* **Centralized Security Orchestration**

  * Unified console to author, version, and deploy Azure Firewall and NSG policies
  * RBAC‑powered approval workflows and full audit logging
* **Self‑Service Portal**

  * Guided “spoke” creation wizard: define subnets, IP ranges, tags, and compliance templates
  * Role‑based access to isolate development, test, and production environments
* **Monitoring & Cost Insights**

  * Real‑time dashboards integrated with Azure Monitor and Network Watcher for traffic flows, top talkers, and alerting
  * Per‑spoke bandwidth and egress reporting with monthly cost breakdowns
* **Compliance & Drift Detection**

  * Scheduled compliance scans (PCI, ISO, GDPR) on firewall rules and NSGs
  * Change‑history tracking with automated drift alerts

**Technology Stack:**

* **Frontend:** React, TypeScript, Tailwind CSS
* **Backend & Automation:**

  * Node.js server that orchestrates ARM/CLI and Terraform workflows
  * Azure Functions for event‑driven tasks (audit reports, drift checks)
* **Infrastructure:** Azure DevOps pipelines, Azure Key Vault, Cosmos DB for metadata storage
* **Monitoring:** Azure Monitor, Log Analytics, Grafana integration

**Impact & Outcomes:**

* **50% faster** deployment of new regional or departmental networks
* **100% policy compliance** through codified security templates and automated audits
* **30% cost savings** by centralizing shared services in the hub and preventing resource sprawl
* Awarded “Innovation Partner of the Quarter” by a Fortune 500 client for delivering the platform under aggressive SLAs.
